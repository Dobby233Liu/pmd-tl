In commemoration of the 30th anniversary of the start of PMD development in 1989,
we are releasing all sources of PMD (the driver) / MC (the compiler) / PMP (the player),
which have been requested by many people especially from overseas.

I used SLR Systems' OPTASM to assemble them.

Version info:
OPTASM.EXE: Copyright (C) SLR Systems 1988-90 Release 1.65
OPTLINK.EXE: Copyright (C) SLR Systems 1989-90 Release 2.11

Execute the assemble.bat in each folder
with the above two paths in %PATH%,
and a executable for the program will be built.

We don't give up copyright on the source, but you are free to use it as you wish.
If you have any ideas on how to reuse this old stuff,
please feel free to do so.

Feel free to contact me on my Twitter or YouTube Channel.
