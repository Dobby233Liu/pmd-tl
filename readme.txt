In commemoration of the 30th anniversary of the development of PMD since 1989,
all sources of PMD (Driver) / MC (Compiler) / PMP (Player),
which have received many requests from overseas, will be released.

I used SLR Systems' "OPTASM" for assembly.

OPTASM.EXE / OPTASM  Copyright (C) SLR Systems 1988-90 Release 1.65
OPTLINK.EXE/ OPTLINK Copyright (C) SLR Systems 1989-90 Release 2.11

Execute the assemble.bat in each folder
with the above two paths passed, and a COM / EXE file will be created.

We don't give up copyright on the source, but you can use it freely.
Rather, if you have any ideas for reusing these old things now,
please do so.

Please contact us on Twitter, YouTube Channel, etc. below.
